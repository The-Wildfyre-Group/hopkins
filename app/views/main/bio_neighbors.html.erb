                  Dr. Harold W. Neighbors recently moved from the University of Michigan to Michigan State University College of Human Medicine to become the second C.S. Mott Endowed Professor of Public Health. With the move to MSU Dr. Neighbors became Professor Emeritus at the UM School of Public Health in the Department of Health Behavior and Health Education and Research Professor Emeritus at the Institute for Social Research. Dr. Neighbors has over 30 years of experience investigating the mental health of Black Americans. Over his career, his work has focused on the community prevalence of psychological distress and major depressive disorder, the use of informal social networks, the (under)use of professional mental health services, and racial influences on the diagnosis of mental disorders. He was a graduate research assistant on the ground-breaking National Survey of Black Americans and a co-investigator on the National Survey of American Life (NSAL) that was part of a National Institute of Mental Health Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys initiative. The NSAL adult sample was an integrated national household probability sample of 3,570 African Americans and 891 non-Hispanic Whites 18 years and older. Using those data, Dr. Neighbors found that Black men were significantly less likely than Black women and White men with major depression to seek help from specialty mental health services or general medical care. In 2010, Dr. Neighbors and his colleagues conducted a large qualitative study titled Man Up Man Down. This original Man Up Man Down project was a four-city (Atlanta, Baltimore, Detroit, and Raleigh) comprised of 12 focus groups. The original Man Up Man Down study obtained rich qualitative information from adult Black men on the meanings and causes of depression, barriers to seeking treatment for depression, and stress exposures including the quest for upward social mobility, race-based blocked opportunities to social advancement, the struggle to be a “real man” (masculinities), the importance of respect, the pain of being disrespected (related to racial discrimination but broader), and family provider role strain. Findings from the first Man Up Man Down study confirmed that Black men are almost uniformly raised to think that they should, whenever possible, face stressful situations alone – to “man up.”

                  Dr. Harold W. Neighbors recently moved from the University of Michigan to Michigan State University College of Human Medicine to become the second C.S. Mott Endowed Professor of Public Health. With the move to MSU Dr. Neighbors became Professor Emeritus at the UM School of Public Health in the Department of Health Behavior and Health Education and Research Professor Emeritus at the Institute for Social Research. Dr. Neighbors has dedicated the bulk of his academic career to mentoring future generations of research scientists from diverse backgrounds and to helping them to conduct research on racial and ethnic health disparities. In 1988 he founded the University of Michigan School of Public Health’s (UMSPH) first diversity research program, the “Paul B. Cornely Postdoctoral Program for Minority Scholars.” To date the Cornely postdoctoral program has trained 30 postdoctoral scholars, most of whom are now tenure-track professors in higher education. As chair of the University of Michigan Master’s of Public Health Admissions Committee for the department of Health Behavior and Health Education, Dr. Neighbors traveled extensively for many years, delivering numerous presentations, developing an assertive outreach campaign in order to increase diversity of the student pool at the UMSPH. He has been an active faculty mentor with the Rackham Graduate School’s Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP) and the University of Michigan’s Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP). In 2006 Dr. Neighbors served as chair of the NIMH African American Mental Health Research Consortium. Between 2002 and 2005, he was Program Director of the NIH-funded “Bridge to the Doctorate Program” and for the last 16 years, I have been Program Director of the NIH/NIGMS-funded research education program, "Promoting Ethnic Diversity in Public Health Doctoral Research Training." Funded by the Division of Training, Workforce Development, and Diversity’s Initiative for Maximizing Student Development. This R25 increased the number of students from underrepresented groups who conduct research on racial and ethnic health disparities. To date the program has provided training and support for 35 scholars who have completed doctoral studies with another 14 scholars currently having achieved doctoral candidacy. More recently, Dr. Neighbors was Interim Director of the Resource Center for Minority Data at the ICPSR within the Institute for Social Research, where my mission also focused on training with an emphasis on quantitative methods. My new MSU appointment, because I now work in Flint, places me in an excellent position to help implement the goals and objective of this proposal.
