Thank you for agreeing to participate in the Black Menâ€™s Health Study. The next step is for me to conduct your interview. The interview may take up to 30 minutes. If you are willing to participate, please keep in mind that this survey is completely voluntary and all information we collect is confidential. You can choose not to answer any question that you want, and you can change your mind and end the interview at any time. You will be compensated for your participation.
